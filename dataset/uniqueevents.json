It is a game of style, control, damage and aggression with the robots pit against each other in a deadly combat.\nCriteria for Victory\n1.     A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized.\n2.     A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot display linear motion of at least one inch in a timed period of 30 seconds. A robot with one side of its drive train disabled will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of conRoommojust enter no robots remain mobile after the end of the round then the winner will be decided subjectively.\n3.     If a robot is thrown out of the arena for one time the match will stop immediately and the robot still inside the arena will be automatically be declared as winner.\n4.   Robots cannot win by pinning or lifting their opponents. Organizers will allow pinning or lifting for a maximum of 20 seconds per pin/lift then the attacker robot will be instructed to release the opponent’s robot. As per the pin or lift time the point will be provided.  If, after being instructed to do so, the attacker is able to release but does not, their robot may be disqualified. If two or more robots become entangled or a crushing or gripping weapon is employed and becomes trapped within another robot, then the competitors should make the timekeeper aware, the fight should be stopped and the robots separated by the safest means.\n     5.    Points will be given on the basis of aggression, damage, control and strategy.\n*       Aggression – Aggression is judged by the severity, boldness and effectiveness of attacks deliberately initiated by the robot against its opponent. If a robot appears to have accidentally attacked an opponent, that act will not be considered Aggression.\n*       Control – Control means a robot is able to attack an opponent at its weakest point, use its weapons in the most effective way, and minimize the damage caused by the opponent or its weapons.\n*       Damage – Through deliberate action, a robot either directly or indirectly reduces the functionality of an opponent.\n*       Strategy – The robot exhibits a combat plan that exploits the robot's strengths against the weaknesses of its opponent. Strategy is also defined as a robot exhibiting a deliberate defence plan that guards its weaknesses against the strengths of the opponent.\n\nNOTE: Qualification of a robot to next level be subjective and totally on the decision of the judges. A robot winning in a round against its opponent doesn't guarantee its entrance into the next round. If the judges found the winner robot incompetent to enter into the next round, it may get disqualified. All the decisions taken by the judge will be final and binding to all. Any queries afterwards will not be entertained.\n\nTeam Specification\nAny team can participate in Robowar. A team may consist of a maximum of 5 participants. \n\nDimension and Fabrication\n*       The machine should fit in a box of dimension 35cm x 30cm x 25cm (l x b x h) at any given point during the match. The external device used to control the machine or any external tank is not included in the size constraint.\n*       The machine should not exceed 15 kg of weight including the weight of pneumatic source/tank. All pneumatic tanks/source and batteries should be on-board. Weight of remote controller will not be counted.\nMobility\nAll robots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete. Methods of mobility include:\n1.     Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot).\n2.     Jumping and hopping is not allowed.\n3.     Flying (using air foil, helium balloons, ornithopters, etc.) is not allowed.\nRobot Control Requirements\n1.     The machine can be controlled through wired and wireless remote. Power supply can be on board and we will provide 220V AC power source. Refer below for further details on battery and power.\n2.     Remote control systems from toys might be used. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used.\n3.     Team should pair up the wireless remote with the machine before putting it into the arena.\nBattery and Power\n4.     The machine can be powered electrically only. Use of an IC engine in any form is not allowed. On board batteries must be sealed. The electric voltage between 2 points anywhere in the machine should not be more than 12V DC at any point of time.\n5.     Change of battery will not be allowed during the match.\n6.     It is suggested to have extra battery ready and charged up during competition so that on advancing to next level, you don’t have to suffer due to uncharged battery. If teams don’t show up on allotted slot, they will be disqualified.\n\n\n\nPneumatics\n1.     Robot can use pressurized non inflammable gases to actuate pneumatic devices. Maximum allowed outlet nozzle pressure is 10 bar.\n2.     Participants must be able to indicate the used pressure with integrated or temporarily fitted pressure gauge. Also there should be provision to check the cylinder pressure on the bot.\n3.     The maximum pressure in cylinder should not exceed the rated pressure at any point of time.\n4.     You must have a safe way of refilling\n5.     All pneumatic components on board a robot must be securely mounted. Care must be taken while mounting the pressure vessel and armor to ensure that if ruptured it will not escape the robot. The terms 'pressure vessel, bottle, and source tank' are used interchangeably.\n6.

We can experiment with simple hydraulics using plastic syringes for cylinders and small plastic tubing for the hydraulic hose. One definition I read for hydraulics was, “the movement of pressurized liquids through confined spaces.”\nTeam members: Each team should have maximum of 4 members\nTime allotted: 2 ½ hours to each teams (for fabrication of Hydraulics Lift)\nSteps to Podium Finish:\n1.\tFirst round is quiz round (based on basic fluid mechanics and hydraulics) which will be a qualified round.\n2.\tThere will be 20 objective questions and time provided will be 15 min.\n3.\tThen the final round i.e., fabrication of Hydraulic lift.\n4.\tWinner will be decided on the basis of Design (5 marks) and Weight lifted by the Arm (20 marks) obtained by respective teams which is decided by our Faculty Advisor.\nMaterials:\n1.\tWooden piECs of required length.\n2.\tPlywood.\n3.\t4 syringes (two of 5 mm & two of 10 mm).\n4.\tOD tubes (24-30 inch long).\n5.\tCello Tape.\n6.\tWashers, Nails and Screw (as per requirement).\n\nRules:\n1.\tEach teams must have 3-4 members only.\n2.\tNo extra material will be allowed for making arm, if done so will lead to disqualification of the team. Only materials provided during final round should be used.\n3.\tThe materials are provided to each team at final round by our coordinators.\n4.\tAny type of argument with coordinators or other teams will result to disqualification of that team.\n5.\tAny type of indiscipline nuisance created shall lead to disqualification.\n6.\tHydraulic RAM is not allowed.\n7.\tDuring testing, no deflection of arm or leakage of syringe will entertained. The testing will stop at that moment.",
