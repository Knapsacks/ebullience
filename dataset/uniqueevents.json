A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized.<br>2.     A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot display linear motion of at least one inch in a timed period of 30 seconds. A robot with one side of its drive train disabled will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of conRoommojust enter no robots remain mobile after the end of the round then the winner will be decided subjectively.<br>3.     If a robot is thrown out of the arena for one time the match will stop immediately and the robot still inside the arena will be automatically be declared as winner.<br>4.   Robots cannot win by pinning or lifting their opponents. Organizers will allow pinning or lifting for a maximum of 20 seconds per pin/lift then the attacker robot will be instructed to release the opponent’s robot. As per the pin or lift time the point will be provided.  If, after being instructed to do so, the attacker is able to release but does not, their robot may be disqualified. If two or more robots become entangled or a crushing or gripping weapon is employed and becomes trapped within another robot, then the competitors should make the timekeeper aware, the fight should be stopped and the robots separated by the safest means.<br>     5.    Points will be given on the basis of aggression, damage, control and strategy.<br>*       Aggression – Aggression is judged by the severity, boldness and effectiveness of attacks deliberately initiated by the robot against its opponent. If a robot appears to have accidentally attacked an opponent, that act will not be considered Aggression.<br>*       Control – Control means a robot is able to attack an opponent at its weakest point, use its weapons in the most effective way, and minimize the damage caused by the opponent or its weapons.<br>*       Damage – Through deliberate action, a robot either directly or indirectly reduces the functionality of an opponent.<br>*       Strategy – The robot exhibits a combat plan that exploits the robot's strengths against the weaknesses of its opponent. Strategy is also defined as a robot exhibiting a deliberate defence plan that guards its weaknesses against the strengths of the opponent.<br>NOTE: Qualification of a robot to next level be subjective and totally on the decision of the judges. A robot winning in a round against its opponent doesn't guarantee its entrance into the next round. If the judges found the winner robot incompetent to enter into the next round, it may get disqualified. All the decisions taken by the judge will be final and binding to all. Any queries afterwards will not be entertained.<br>Team Specification<br>Any team can participate in Robowar.

The external device used to control the machine or any external tank is not included in the size constraint.<br>*       The machine should not exceed 15 kg of weight including the weight of pneumatic source/tank. All pneumatic tanks/source and batteries should be on-board. Weight of remote controller will not be counted.<br>Mobility<br>All robots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete. Methods of mobility include:<br>1.     Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot).<br>2.     Jumping and hopping is not allowed.<br>3.     Flying (using air foil, helium balloons, ornithopters, etc.) is not allowed.<br>Robot Control Requirements<br>1.     The machine can be controlled through wired and wireless remote. Power supply can be on board and we will provide 220V AC power source. Refer below for further details on battery and power.<br>2.     Remote control systems from toys might be used. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used.<br>3.     Team should pair up the wireless remote with the machine before putting it into the arena.<br>Battery and Power<br>4.     The machine can be powered electrically only. Use of an IC engine in any form is not allowed. On board batteries must be sealed.
